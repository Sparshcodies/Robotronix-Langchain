Use the link to access your delivery status, tracking number and courier. You can also use the steps above to track your order and access your tracking number. Why hasn't my tracking information updated? Don't worry if your tracking information doesn't immediately populate—the carrier sometimes takes up to 48 hours to activate the tracking information. Please check back, the tracking information should update soon. Why is my order delayed? We do our absolute best to deliver your order on time, but high order volume sometimes slows us down. After an order is dispatched, your package could also be delayed by delivery issues such as severe weather, an incomplete delivery address or regional service delays. Why was only part of my order delivered? If you order multiple items, you may get multiple deliveries. We'll send you a delivery confirmation email for each delivery, so you'll know exactly what to expect and when to expect it. What should I do if my order is marked as delivered but I didn't receive it? Sometimes carrier-tracking information updates prematurely and your package could be delivered within 24 hours.

Draw entries can't be changed once they've been submitted. Make sure you check your selected size before joining. Can I opt out of a draw if I'm selected? No, when you join a draw, you're agreeing to purchase the shoes. But if you've changed your mind, you can return them . Please refer to our terms and conditions for more information.
